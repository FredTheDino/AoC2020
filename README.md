# AoC - 2020
This year I decided to write in Hy, after a lot of back and forth. Hy is a Lisp dialect which uses the Python interpreter under the hood. This gives you the whole standard library of Python which is pretty nice.

## To run
The input files are bundled in the clone, since I figured most people would
want to run them if they clone the code.

### Run with Hy
```
make
```

### Run with Python
```
make PYTHON=True
```
